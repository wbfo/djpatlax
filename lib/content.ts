    long: `DJ Pat Lax is a Nigerian-American DJ and cultural curator who has become one of New York City's most sought-after talents for Afrobeats, Amapiano, and global sounds. Born in Brooklyn and raised in Staten Island, Pat's journey is deeply rooted in his Nigerian heritage from Sagamu and Abeokuta.

Growing up in New York's diverse cultural landscape, Pat Lax developed an ear for blending sounds that speak to multiple generations and cultures. His sets seamlessly transition between Afrobeats, Amapiano, Dancehall, Soca, Hip Hop, and Reggaeton, creating an atmosphere that feels both authentic and progressive.

Pat Lax first gained recognition with his marathon 5-hour radio sets and has since performed at some of the industry's most prestigious platforms. His appearances on Hot97's "Who's Next" and Revolt TV's Art Fair at Art Basel Miami showcased his ability to command any crowd. He's also played NBA All Star Weekend after-parties, Davido after-parties in Brooklyn, and was a featured DJ at Afrocarnival alongside DJ Tunez.

In 2023, Pat Lax launched Outside Agenda, an immersive event series that brings Afrobeats experiences to diverse audiences across NYC. The series has grown from underground parties to major venues, including community events like the Carter Center summer bash with free food and games, and citywide Juneteenth celebrations. Outside Agenda represents Pat's commitment to using music as a bridge between cultures.

With over 18K Instagram followers and features on Heavy Hits playlists, Pat Lax continues to push the boundaries of what a DJ can be—not just a performer, but a cultural ambassador bringing authentic African sounds to every dance floor.`
